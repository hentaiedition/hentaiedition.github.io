## Try it out now

The Containerized Subsystem for Hentai makes Windows Hentai Edition act like an app on your computer.
You can open it and run programs in it without affecting the rest of your PC.
It requires Windows 7 or later and 16 GB of free space (not all of that will be used up).

1. Download these two files: [Part 1](https://github.com/hentaiedition/main/releases/download/rtm/GithubRTM_Container.part1.exe) and [Part 2](https://github.com/hentaiedition/main/releases/download/rtm/GithubRTM_Container.part2.rar).
2. Run the EXE file to start the installation.

This option is designed for users who are not already using virtualization software.
If you already use VMware, VirtualBox, etc., download the ISO instead as described below.

## Or, install in a VM or on a real machine

Hentai Edition comes in an ISO file, which can be attached to a virtual machine or burned onto a disk and installed on a real PC.
If you are setting up a VM, choose Windows XP 32-bit as the guest OS.
If you are installing on a real machine, use a computer from between 2000-2010.

1. Download these two files: [Part 1](https://github.com/hentaiedition/main/releases/download/rtm/GithubRTM_ISO.part1.exe) and [Part 2](https://github.com/hentaiedition/main/releases/download/rtm/GithubRTM_ISO.part2.rar).
2. Run the EXE file to extract the ISO to any folder you want.

For Linux and Mac users: Instead of running the EXE, use 7-zip or a similar program to open it as an archive and extract the ISO to a folder.

## FAQ

#### Why are there two parts to each option?
Github can't handle files over 2 GB. The ISO is 2.6 GB and the container is around 4 GB, so they have to be split.

Some really bad Protegent-level antiviruses may complain about the self-extractor EXEs. These antiviruses will complain about literally any self extractor, even one with just CMD in it. If you are concerned, you can use 7-zip or WinRAR to extract the files from them directly.

#### Will the Containerized Subsystem for Hentai screw up my files?
It shouldn't. After all, it's built on VirtualBox, which is tried-and-tested open source software used by millions.

#### What OS is this based on?
Windows NT 5.1 (Windows XP) service pack 3. Almost all available updates have been slipstreamed into the install disk.

#### Is Hentai Edition open-source?
Not yet, but eventually most of the applications on it will be.

#### Is this a real OS or a meme?
This is a meme. Do not use it for anything important.
