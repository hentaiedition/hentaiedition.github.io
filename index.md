## Or, install in a VM or on a real machine

Hentai Edition comes in an ISO file, which can be attached to a virtual machine or burned onto a disk and installed on a real PC.
If you are setting up a VM, choose Windows XP 32-bit as the guest OS.
If you are installing on a real machine, use a computer from between 2000-2010.

1. Download these two files: [Part 1](https://github.com/hentaiedition/main/releases/download/rtm/GithubRTM_ISO.part1.exe) and [Part 2](https://github.com/hentaiedition/main/releases/download/rtm/GithubRTM_ISO.part2.rar).
